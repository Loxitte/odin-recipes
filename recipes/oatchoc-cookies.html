        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>These filling and flavorful cookies were a staple in my house growing up. Nothing satisfies a sweet tooth quite like them. You can even convince yourself they're a breakfast food if you're imaginitive enough!</p>

            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda then set aside.</li>

            <li>Stir in the oats and chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>If you have the time and patience, store and chill dough in the fridge for one hour to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).</li>
            <li>Line 2 baking sheets or pans with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Use a small ice cream scooper or large spoon to drop heaping tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the parchment-lined pans.</li>
            <li>Bake about 8 to 10 minutes, or until cookies are golden aroung the edges but still soft in the center.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool on baking sheets for 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
