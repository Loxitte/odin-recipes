        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
          <p>A beautiful mix of sweet muffins and tart blueberries. This one is a favorite of Austin's, and he has the secret to making them extra moist and delicious!</p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>All-purpose flour: 1 1/2 cups</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar: 3/4 cup</li>
            <li>Baking powder: 2 teaspoons</li>
            <li>Fine salt: 1/4 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil: 1/3 cup</li>
            <li>Large egg: 1</li>
            <li>Milk of choice: 1/3 cup</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract: 1 1/2 teaspoons</li>
            <li>Fresh or frozen blueberries: 1 cup</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
       
        <p><ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Line muffin cups with paper liners (8 for big muffins, 10 for standard size).</li>
            <li>Lightly grease or spray top of pan with oil of choice to prevent muffin tops from sticking to pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whick together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl or measuring jug that holds at least 1 cup, add oil and crack in the egg. Pour enough milk to reach the 1-cup line of the jug. Add vanilla extract and whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Stire gently until combined.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the blueberries. Do not overmix! The batter will be thick.</li>
            <li>Divide batter between the muffin cups. If you want big-topped muffins, fill to the top of the cups.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a little sugar on top of each muffin.</li>
            <li>Bake muffins for 15 to 20 minutes or until the tops are no longer wet and the toothpick inserted in the center comes out with crumbs, not wet batter.</li>
            <li>Let cool for a few minutes before transferring baked muffins to a drying rack.</li>
        </ol></p>
