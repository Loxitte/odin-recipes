        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Chewy, moist, and sweet like a temperate spring day, banana bread is a favorite in our household. This recipe is perfect for when you've overestimated your family's capacity to finish off a bunch of bananas before they go bad. Not to worry, you can give these abandoned fruits a whole new life with just a bit of baking magic!</p>
        
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Flour: 2 cups</li>
            <li>Baking soda: 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Salt: 1/4 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Brown sugar: 3/4 cup</li>
            <li>Butter: 1/2 cup</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Overripe bananas: 2 1/3 cups (around 4-5 bananas)</li>
            <li>(Optional) About 1 cup of any nuts or other additions you may like. My favorite is chocolate chips!</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <p>(It is helpful to leave the butter on the counter to soften a few hours before you make your batter. Alternatively you can use a microwave to soften it.)</p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan with an oil of your choice.</li>
            <li>Peel and mash overripe bananas in a medium-sized bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl, whisking until evenly incorporated.</li>
            <li>Beat brown sugar and butter in a separate large bowl until smooth. (Using an electric mixer is easiest, but a little elbow grease can go a long way!)</li>
            <li>Stir eggs and mashed bananas into the sugar and butter mixture until well blended.</li>
            <li>Stir flour mixture into banana mixture until just combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in any additions until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the greased loaf pan.</li> 
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven about 60 minutes, though this may vary. Check often around the 60-minute mark and use a toothpick to inseert into the center. If it comes out clean, it's ready!</li>  
            <li>Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Bask in the glory of your delcious loaf! Slice and serve.</li>
        </ol></p>
